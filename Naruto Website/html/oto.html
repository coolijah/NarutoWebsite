Otogakure: Hidden Village in the Sound
</span>

<br>
<br>
<div class="par">
    A relatively new Hidden Village founded by Orochimaru after his desertion from the Akatsuki organization no more than 10 years ago. The former country, the Land of Rice Fields, was virtually taken over by Orochimaru in order to establish his Hidden Village in the Sound.  The Sound ninjas all have abnormal techniques, usually due to experimentation by Orochimaru.  Many specialize in techniques involving the manipulation of sound waves while an elite few possess the use of Cursed Seals. The Sound and Sand formed a temporary alliance in a plan by Orochimaru to invade Konoha.  The plan failed resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.</div>
