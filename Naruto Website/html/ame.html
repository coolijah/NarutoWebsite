Amegakure: Hidden Village in the Rain
</span>

<br>
<br>
<div class="par">
    The Rain ninjas specialize in specific types of water element jutsus. Amegakure is highly secretive and protective of its information; many countriescomplained about this fact when the Chuunin exams were held there.  Because of the high level of security, it is very difficult to receive news from the inside.  As a result, a costly civil war between two factions within the village was nearly unknown to outsiders for many years.  The war ended after the assassination of the former leader of the Rain, a legendary shinobi known as Hanzou, and the extermination of all his relatives and allies.  After that, the village fell under the control of Pein, a mysterious shinobi who was formerly believed to be the leader of the Akatsuki organization. </div>
