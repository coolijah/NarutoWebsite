Sunagakure no Sato: Hidden Village of the Sand

<div class="par">
    Sunagakure is the shinobi village of Land of Wind and is one of the five great shinobi villages.  It was created some 70 years ago through the gathering a large number of shinnobi. The techniques of Suna’s ninjas include the use of wind, sand and special puppet jutsus. Around 20 years ago, the Daimyo of Wind country began to reduce economic support to the Village. Sunagakura was forced to reduce the number of its ninjas, but compensated by increasing the quality of each one. This is one of the reasons why 16 years ago the Kazekage, leader of the Sand, ordered the sealing of the One-Tailed bijuu (demon beast) in his unborn child, Gaara.

    Three years ago, Yodaime Kazekage made an alliance with Orochimaru to invade Konoha. However, the Kage was betrayed and killed. His successor and youngest son, Gaara, made peace with Konoha. Today, Konoha and Suna are allies and even have an exchange training program.  Recently, the Akatsuki organization kidnapped the new Kazekage and extracted the bijuu that was sealed within him. Fortunately, Gaara was rescued by the Leaf’s ninjas, and was revived. </div>
