Kirigakure: Hidden Village in the Mist

<br>

<div class="par">
    Kirigakure is the shinobi village of the Land of Water and is one of the five most powerful hidden villages, however due internal fighting, it is no longer as powerful as it once was. The Mist had in the past a large number of clans with powerful bloodline limit abilities and most shinobi are highly skilled in water based techniques. But due to their cruel training methods, the village also earned the name of the Bloody Mist. In the past, to graduate as Genins, students were forced to fight to the death against fellow friends and classmates. This tradition was terminated 22 years ago when one student, Zabuza Momochi, killed not only his opponent but more than 100 other students during the Genin trials. </div>

    The Land of Water took part in many wars in the past. The citizens suffered and blamed the clans that had Kekkei Genkais (bloodline limit abilities), and wiped out many of them some 19 years ago). Some shinobis fled while others hid their powers in order to live as normal citizens. In latter years, those who were discovered with bloodline abilities were feared, mistreated, and left without training in the Water country (see Haku, Kimimaro Kaguya and Ranmaru).
