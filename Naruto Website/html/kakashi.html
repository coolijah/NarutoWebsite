<span class="subheadings1">BACKGROUND</span>

<hr size="3" color="#0000ff" width="100%">

<br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, a genius who was renowned as "Konoha's White Fang". Not much is known of his mother other than that she died at a young age. Kakashi himself has been referred to as a prodigy. Because of his great skill and aptitude, he graduated from the Academy in a single year at the top of his class at age five, eventually joining a team under Minato Namikaze alongside Obito Uchiha and Rin Nohara. A year later, Kakashi became chunin after facing and defeating Might Guy during the third stage of the Chunin Exams.
Despite his own successes, his father fell into disgrace after choosing to save his comrades rather than complete an important mission, which caused the nation and the village to suffer a great loss. Dishonoured, Sakumo took his own life after suffering a deep depression and drop in his skills; this experience made Kakashi determined to lead his life strictly by the ninja code.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Third Shinobi World War</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Soon after becoming a jonin, Kakashi was assigned to lead his team-mates Obito and Rin on a mission that would benefit Konoha in the ongoing Third Shinobi World War. They were to destroy Kannabi Bridge, which was being used by Iwagakure forces to move into Kusagakure. This would also be Konoha's first huge offensive move in the war. On their way to the bridge, Rin was kidnapped by two Iwagakure ninja named Kakko and Taiseki. Obito immediately suggested that they rescue her, but Kakashi disagreed on the basis that they needed to complete their mission, opting not to make the same mistake his father did in his mission.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Obito would not hear of it and stubbornly left to save Rin, but not before mentioning that he believed Kakashi's father, the White Fang, was a true hero. Shortly after parting ways, Kakashi reflected on Obito's words and Rin's prior kindness. He realised that his father was not wrong after all, which prompted him to join Obito in the rescue effort. Kakashi arrived in time to save Obito from Taiseki, using his father's blade to combat him. Despite the two-to-one disadvantage, the more experienced Taiseki was able to attack and damage Kakashi's left eye, who took the blow that was intended for Obito, giving him a permanent scar and blinding his left eye.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Obito's will to protect his comrades caused his Sharingan to awaken, and he used it to kill Taiseki. After finding Rin and defeating Kakko with Obito's help, Kakashi freed Rin from the genjutsu before their opponent attempted to trap them in a cave-in. While trying to escape, Kakashi was hit by a rock, which he didn't notice because of his bandaged eye, causing him to fall. Obito pushed Kakashi out of the path of a falling boulder, he himself getting crushed beneath it instead. Knowing he was dying, Obito requested his Sharingan be a belated present to Kakashi and instructed Rin to implant his left Sharingan into Kakashi's damaged eye. Rin complied, and as soon as the surgery was completed Kakashi used his new Sharingan to perfect his Chidori and kill Kakko. He then returned to Obito to see if there was anything he could do for him, but alongside Rin was forced to leave him. With the help of Minato, they ultimately completed their mission, allowing them to mourn Obito's supposed death. Later, in the anime, Kakashi and Rin's team was given Might Guy as a replacement. It was during this mission that Kakashi and Guy found true trust and teamwork with each other, and where Kakashi famously split a lightning bolt with his Chidori, giving birth to its new name Lightning Cutter.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Some time after the events at Kannabi Bridge, Kakashi and Rin were apparently sent out on a mission where they were ambushed by jonin and ANBU-level Kirigakure shinobi. The events of this encounter culminated in a tearful Kakashi running Rin through her chest with his Chidori. Shortly afterwards, Kakashi and Obito — who witnessed it from behind the scenes — developed their fully-matured Sharingan and subsequently awakened the Mangekyo Sharingan at precisely the same time. Exhausted and overwhelmed with sorrow, Kakashi lost consciousness as Obito took his rage out on the Kirigakure ninja, slaughtering them all. Though Kakashi was the one who killed Rin, Obito left him alive as he was found by Konoha ninja soon after.

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Post-War</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

After the conclusion of the war, Kakashi would often visit Rin and Obito's respective graves in the Konoha Cemetery and the Memorial Stone. On one such occasion, he visited Rin's grave and told her that their sensei's son would be born soon and left to go to the stone, unaware that Obito overheard him from afar and used that information to free the Nine-Tails and have the tailed beast ravage their village. During the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha, Kakashi and the rest of his peers were barred from participating in defending the village by Kurenai Yuhi's father and other senior shinobi for their own safety as the younger generation.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Over the years, Kakashi became well-known among all the Five Great Shinobi Countries for the extensive use of his Sharingan, gaining him a reputation as "the man who has copied over a thousand techniques", hence his nickname. Kakashi eventually joined the Konoha ANBU, and also served as a mentor to Yamato whose codename was "Tenzo" at that time.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

He later left for unknown reasons, but maintained strong connections with the ANBU. Kakashi eventually became a team leader, and tested many genin. As the Third Hokage told Iruka Umino, Kakashi had never passed any of them due to their inability to live up to his expectations of working as a team.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

In the anime, he once had a mission where Iruka, his team-mate at the time, was injured and became an instructor at the Academy. When Iruka was having doubts at being assigned to be the home room teacher of Naruto Uzumaki, Kakashi served to remind him of his real reasons for wanting the post in the first place.

</div>

<br><br><br>

<span class="subheadings1">PERSONALITY</span>

<hr size="3" color="#0000ff" width="100%">

<br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi became more stern and serious after his father's death, following all the rules to the letter and chastising any who disobeyed them, like his team-mate Obito Uchiha. He was also very aloof and apathetic to others especially his team-mate Obito who was always late for their missions and would come in tow with a grand excuse. This caused Obito to resent Kakashi; the dynamics between the two would soon change after Obito was mortally wounded during the Third Shinobi World War, with Kakashi and Obito becoming closer friends after Rin was abducted.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Obito's supposed death had a huge impact on Kakashi's personality, adopting many of his friend's cheerful mannerisms such as having greater concern for his team-mates and students over the successful completion of a mission, as well as believing that teamwork is essential to overall success as a team. He has also developed a somewhat carefree personality and is regularly late for appointments, making obvious excuses just like Obito before him. This is often because he loses track of time during his frequent visits to the memorial stone where Obito's name is engraved. However, Kakashi is still just as apathetic as he was during his youth, often speaking bluntly about sensitive topics.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Though his childhood was riddled with numerous despairs that took those dear away from him, one being the death of Rin by his own hand, Kakashi is on the best terms with his childhood friends: Guy, Asuma, and Kurenai, his students and generally with everyone in Konoha to a lesser extent. His devotion to his friends and the rest of Konoha were the motivation to perfect both the Chidori, and its enhanced version Lightning Cutter. After the formation of Team 7, Kakashi begins taking a special interest in his students' development, especially in the case of Naruto and Sasuke whose rivalry reminded him of his relation to Obito. Like Hiruzen, Kakashi loved all of his students deeply, turning down a mission to stop Naruto and Sasuke from killing each other. Despite Sasuke allying with Orochimaru, Kakashi shared Naruto's hope that they could save him. However, Kakashi became originally distraught about having to kill Sasuke after he became an enemy of Konoha, especially since he felt that it was his shortcomings as their teacher that attributed to this, but then furiously discarding his hesitation, only after Sasuke attempted to kill Sakura without a second thought.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi has a rather solitary, and matter-of-fact attitude. His calm and detached demeanour has been called "cool, hip, and trendy" many times by Might Guy. Despite his increasingly growing reputation and prowess as a ninja, Kakashi has shown no signs of arrogance, and is rather modest about his abilities, as shown when he readily praises others for leaps in their combat abilities and stating on more than one occasion that Naruto has surpassed him in power. When suggested by many for him to become Hokage, Kakashi admitted being unworthy but would accept the post for the sake of the village's well being. His naturally calm attitude is used to his advantage in battle, as it becomes easier for him to maintain his composure and stay focused on the situation at hand, and notice everything around him. As a result, he can quickly adjust to any situation to make keen and thought-out decisions, allowing him to stay steps ahead of his opponents.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Despite his calm demeanour, Kakashi does have an emotional side, as he noted during the Fourth Shinobi World War that it took a lot to get him worked up, but when he did, he would go on a merciless rampage against the enemy. He was later horrified at the fact that Tobi was actually his thought to be deceased comrade Obito, to the point that he became momentarily depressed and was no longer reacted to what was occurring on the battlefield. Despite this, Kakashi was eventually able to snap out of this state with new found resolve, and showed Obito no mercy on the battlefield despite their past friendship.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi has an ongoing, albeit one-sided, somewhat childish rivalry with Guy. In trying to prove himself superior to Kakashi, Guy challenges him to competitions of questionable value ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to running races. Guy has a record of 50 wins to 49 losses, which he is particularly proud of, despite these competitions having little accuracy due to their large variations. In the anime, Kakashi has a 51:50 win-lose record. Kakashi, on the other hand, shows very little interest in their competitions, which only further inspires Guy to defeat Kakashi and his "coolness". However, Kakashi did show disappointment when he learned that Guy taught Lee how to open the dangerous Eight Gates, which turned to sympathy when Guy shows how much his student meant to him. Nevertheless, both men are great friends and also have the utmost faith in each other seen during the Fourth Shinobi World War when they entrusted the protection of their blind spots to each other. This was also expanded on in the anime, where Kakashi told Tsunade that he would need a second-in-command during the war and wanted Guy to serve that purpose.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi is an avid fan of the Icha Icha series of novels by Jiraiya, revealing a perverted side. He is typically seen reading one of the books in his spare time, making it the only one of his reportedly several hobbies that is ever seen in the series. He even went and read it during his first bell test with the newly formed Team 7 as he deemed Naruto too weak of a threat. However, during the second bell test with Naruto and Sakura, Kakashi lost to his students when his love for the book series was used against him and he was forced into covering his ears and closing his eyes to avoid being told the ending of the latest instalment he had yet to read at the time. Despite his fondness for the books, Kakashi is uncomfortable about reading passages to others (even around his ninken), presumably embarrassed by the adult content (as noted when they were decoding Jiraiya's last message).

</div>

<br><br><br>

<span class="subheadings1">Special Skills</span>

<hr size="3" color="#0000ff" width="100%">

<br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi is hailed as a natural genius, evidenced by his meteoric rise through the ninja ranks; graduating from the Academy top of his class at age 5, becoming a chunin at age 6, a jonin at age 13, and his high status in ANBU. Naruto notes that much of Kakashi's battle prowess and skills is greater than his friends who showed exceptional might in their own specific skills. A match for seemingly any opponent, it was also noted by Tsunade that Kakashi is easily one of Konoha's strongest ninja. His various accomplishments have earned him much praise by his fellow Konoha ninja and he holds a position of great influence amongst them. He is frequently given responsibility for important tasks, such as watching Naruto in case the seal of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox begins to fail as well as being considered the most suitable candidate for the position of Hokage.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Other ninja villages are very aware of Kakashi and his abilities, and upon meeting him in battle, become afraid or excited by the challenge Kakashi will pose. Pain, an extremely powerful member of Akatsuki, fear that Kakashi would interfere with Akatsuki's plans if left alive. This was later validated in the Fourth Shinobi World War when Kakashi defeated most of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist and later hold off several "Version 2" state jinchuriki together with Might Guy.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Taijutsu </span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi is very adept in taijutsu. In the anime, as a child, he was skilled enough to draw out his sensei Minato Namikaze in his bell test, managing to touch one of the bells. As an adult, his improved skill was noted to be greater than Rock Lee in Part I, who is a taijutsu master-in-training. He is also noted to have impressive speed; being able to intercept an opponent even from a distance as seen during the very start of the bell test. Even when greatly outnumbered by hundreds of shadow clones, he is easily able to defeat them.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

His battle prowess and speed allow him to effectively catch his opponents off-guard to quickly strike them down and easily evade attacks. His speed increased considerably in Part II, before the timeskip he had difficulty keeping up with Itachi Uchiha, but matched the Akatsuki member after the timeskip. His hand seal prowess has also been noted as being very great, able to perform them at highly difficult speeds to follow.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

He is also able to open at least one of the Eight Gates, a feat that very few ninja are able to achieve. In the anime, he can also utilise advanced techniques derived from it while showing no signs of even fatigue afterwards. His raw strength is also noticeably high, able to in Part I simultaneously throw both Naruto and Sasuke a large distance, and in Part II easily lift and wield the giant blade of Zabuza Momochi, Kubikiribocho, with a single hand despite its considerable weight.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Ninjutsu</span> 

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi primarily relies on his mastery of ninjutsu, of which he has a vast arsenal due to his Sharingan; being noted to have copied over a thousand techniques, the number has continuously been growing through his many battles. With this arsenal, he can attack or defend against his opponents in numerous manners. He can also enhance his physical tools, channelling lightning-nature chakra through them. Kakashi is also able to summon a pack of ninja hounds to aid him in battle, and for other purposes such as tracking down individuals.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Nature Transformation</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par"> 

In addition to the sheer number of techniques he is purported to know, he is also proficient in several nature transformations. He has a natural affinity for Lightning Release, which he mastered before even becoming a jonin. It became so advanced that it is an attribute enemy ninja identify him by. His prowess with Water Release techniques is such that he can match specialists like Zabuza Momochi and perform them without a nearby water source. He has used Earth Release techniques, able to move fast and unnoticed underground or produce large and intricate earthen walls rather quickly. He has also shown considerable skill in Fire Release techniques, and he is otherwise at least knowledgeable enough to train others in Wind Release.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

When Kakashi learned how to use the Rasengan, he attempted to infuse it with lightning-chakra as it was originally intended to be combined with element chakra, but ultimately failed. However, he used the same theoretical principle to create the Chidori, which he later refined into the far stronger, Lightning Cutter. He can also enlist the aid of a shadow clone, to create a lightning chain able to cut through even a jinchuriki's chakra arms in a "Version 2" state. He can also create a lightning-infused clone, and hound via his manipulation of lightning-chakra.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Genjutsu</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

While used less often, he has also shown skill in genjutsu, which he can use as a set-up for stronger attacks. His skill in its usage is able to easily deceive most opponents with well-timed diversions, giving his opponents little chance to counter. During the bell test for Team 7, Kakashi was able to use low-level techniques to easily subdue a keen-minded and natural genjutsu-type like Sakura. Against high-level genjutsu such as the Temple of Nirvana Technique, he has advanced knowledge of their working, and is able to dispel genjutsu as well.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Sharingan</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi's most distinguishing ability is his Sharingan, a gift from his friend Obito Uchiha, as its ability to have him to copy nearly any technique used against him gave him the moniker Copy Ninja Kakashi (?????????, Kopi Ninja no Kakashi) while seeing through any deception, give hypnotic suggestions, perform genjutsu, and predict his opponent's movements or knock them out. This was seen in action twice, once against Zabuza Momochi and then against on Root members sent to watch Naruto. This eye also gives Kakashi a heightened visual perception to his surroundings. This allows Kakashi to overcome the normal tunnel-effect caused from extreme speeds, also allowing him to use his Lightning Cutter to its fullest while still able to see his opponents clearly.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

However, because Kakashi is not of Uchiha blood and cannot deactivate it, he uses a massive amount of chakra to utilise his Sharingan, keeping it covered when not in battle and taking extended bed rest from using it extensively. Because of this, Kakashi only relies on it when he feels it is an absolute necessity. Despite his handicap with the Sharingan, he is very skilled in using it; Itachi Uchiha, a true heir and master of the Sharingan, acknowledged Kakashi's proficiency with the Sharingan compared to most true Sharingan wielders.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

When he first received the Sharingan it had only two tomoe. Some time after this, the traumatic loss of his dear friend Rin caused Kakashi's Sharingan to fully mature. In addition, Kakashi has extended the duration of time he can sustain using the Sharingan. In Part I, he could only handle using it for a short while in battle while suffering somewhat crippling effects such as severe fatigue. In Part II, he is seen using it for seemingly a day while testing Naruto and Sakura without any adverse effects.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Mangekyo Sharingan</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Kakashi awakened his Mangekyo Sharingan after killing Rin, though seemed unaware of its awakening until years later. With it he can perform Kamui: a technique that creates a space-time barrier in the form of a swirling void that sucks any target he focuses his eye on to another dimension and also bring them back; even transporting them to a new location in some instances. Originally, Kakashi lacked proper control to hit his target properly. His skill later improved greatly, able to successfully warp small, fast-moving, or multiple targets in rapid succession as seen against Pain, and Sasuke Uchiha respectively. Even Obito Uchiha, a former ally and master of Kamui, openly acknowledged Kakashi's great skill with the technique. While battling Obito, Kakashi attempted to use Kamui to behead the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path: an object of significant size and mass, failing only because of Obito's intervention. His finesse allows him to safely warp chakra-based techniques, like the Rasengan, or even shadow clones without disrupting them, at such speed that Obito himself was fooled into believing Kakashi failed and dispelled the technique instead. While originally demonstrating only long-range use, Kakashi is also able to use Kamui at a short-range. With this new proficiency, Kakashi is also able to teleport himself at will.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Kamui's chakra requirements are even greater than those of the standard Sharingan, such that initially he had to be hospitalised for a week after using it three times in one day. By his battle against Obito however, his mastery of this technique improved further, able to use it at least five times, three of which in quick succession (along with other chakra-taxing techniques like the Lightning Cutter) and still had enough strength left to act. Afterwards, though tired, he remarked that he retained enough chakra to use the technique a few more times, and only after the fourth use did he start experiencing the immediate side effects. He is also aware of other Mangekyo Sharingan techniques as well as the risks the dojutsu poses to the user's eyesight.
