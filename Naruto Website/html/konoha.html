Konoha: Hidden Village of the Leaf

<br>

<div class="par">
   Konoha is the hidden ninja village in the Land of Fire and its primary source of military power.  Konaha is one of the five major shinobi villages and is also one of the more wealthy villages due to the large number of missions it receives.  Konoha supports one of the strongest military force in the Naruto world, but its strength has been significantly weakened since Orochimaru’s attack.  It is also home to many powerful clans, some with unique bloodline abilities such as the Byakugan.  Being citizens of the Land of Fire, the inhabitants of Konoha believe in the Will of Fire and many of its shinobi possess the ability to use basic fire-based jutsus.</div>

    This village was founded around 70 years ago, by Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha.  Konoha’s clans possess many powerful kekkei genkais such as: Sharingan, Byakugan, and Mokuton jutsu. Almost 16 years ago, Konoha was attacked by the Kyuubi Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. Many shinobis died, including the Fourth Hokage who sacrificed himself to seal the beast insside his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki. About 7 to 9 years ago, the Konoha’s Uchiha clan was virtually wiped out. It is rumoured that the Uchihas were plotting to execute a coup d'état, and that the village leaders had ordered the massacre in order to stop them. Some three years ago, Konoha was attacked by the combined forces and the Sand and Sound villages.  The plot, orchestrated by missing nin Orochimaru, failed but the Third Hokage was killed and the loss of so many experienced shinobi in the fighting greatly diminished Fire country’s power.</div>
