BACKGROUND

<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">

<br>
<div class="par">
On the day that he was to become a student at the Academy, Obito arrived late to the opening ceremony. Believing that he arrived too late he was relieved when Rin Nohara handed him his orientation-documents. He would eventually graduate at the age of 9 and was placed in Team Minato with Rin and Kakashi Hatake under the leadership of Minato Namikaze. The team took part in the Chunin Exams, where Obito arrived late for a second round in the Forest of Death having stopped to help an elderly woman. When Team Minato ran across an enemy team, Obito attempted to impress Rin with the Uchiha clan's fire technique, but ended up chocking on the candy the elderly woman gave him and was promptly defeated by Might Guy. Training extensively between the second and third round and told Rin his dream of becoming Hokage. He was however eliminated from the exams in another bout with Guy, who was then beaten by Kakashi allowing him to rise to the rank of chunin. Obito did attain the rank some years later but was overshadowed by Kakashi becoming a jonin and the subsequent surprise celebration Rin was planning for him.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
During the Third Shinobi World War, Kakashi was placed in charge of the team for a mission to destroy the Kannabi Bridge, which would hinder Iwagakure from using Kusagakure as a relief point. Before beginning the mission, Minato and Rin gave gifts to Kakashi to celebrate his promotion to jonin, though Obito had forgotten thus straining an already poor relationship. Minato would soon be called to the front lines, leaving the team to carry on the mission alone. The three were then discovered by Iwa-nin and Rin was captured. Kakashi elected to abandon Rin, believing it was more important to finish the mission before concerning themselves with her safety. Obito became enraged at the idea and insisted that they focus on her rescue. When Kakashi refused, Obito left on his own, remarking that Kakashi was worse than scum for abandoning his friends.
Obito found the cave the Iwa-nin were using as a hideout, but before he could make much progress, was found and attacked by a camouflaged Taiseki. Kakashi having a change of heart because of Obito's parting words, arrived and saved Obito, shielding him from Taiseki's attack, but damaging his left eye in the process. To save his team-mate, Obito awakened his Sharingan for the first time, allowing him to see through Taiseki's camouflage and kill him. The two found and released Rin from her restraints, prompting Kakko to bring the cave down around them. As they made their escape, Kakashi's limited vision greatly hindered him, and when Obito noticed he was about to be crushed by a falling boulder in his blind spot, he pushed him out of the way and became trapped under the rubble in his place, crushing the right half of his body. With no way to escape, Obito accepted his fate and made an offering: to give Kakashi his left Sharingan as an apology for forgetting to get him a present earlier.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Obito trapped beneath the boulder.
Rin performed the transplant and once the procedure was finished, Kakashi used his new Sharingan to kill Kakko. The Iwa reinforcements quickly began to further compress the rubble forcing Kakashi and Rin to leave Obito behind. As the rocks tightened around him, Obito lamented that he had finally became friends with Kakashi and failed he couldn't confess his feelings for Rin. Afterwards, Minato rescued Kakashi and Rin and Obito was believed dead, his name marked in Konoha's memorial.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
But in actuality, Obito was somehow rescued by an elderly Madara Uchiha who found the Uchiha when the cave-in brought him to one of his tunnels leading to the Mountains' Graveyard.  
</div>

	<td colspan="2" class="maintd">

<br>

<div class="par">
Though his Sharingan was miraculously unharmed, the entire side of his body from the neck down was completely destroyed, prompting Madara to reconstruct half of his body using parts of Hashirama's living clone.Telling Obito that he now owes him his life, Obito instead declared he wanted to return to Konoha and be with his friends. Madara informed him that his new body would prevent him from becoming a shinobi again, and that in the end it wouldn't matter. Madara preached about the harsh nature of reality and how he has a plan to change the world. Still unconvinced, but otherwise unable to leave, Obito remained in the Mountain Graveyard to recuperate.During his recuperation, he met and became friends with White Zetsu and one of his many clone brothers while undergoing rehabilitation in order to use his new limbs.
As Obito was finally getting used to his new limbs, White Zetsu alerted him to the fact that Kakashi and Rin were surrounded by Kirigakure-nin and in danger. Obito tried to punch through the wall blocking the Mountain Graveyard, but ended up destroying his right arm and barely breaking the wall. Spiral Zetsu, wanting to help and sure Madara would allow it, encased Obito with his body which gave him the strength to break the wall. As Obito prepared to leave, he told Madara he had no intention of returning, but thanked him for saving his life. Madara in turn told him that he will return willingly and thank him truthfully. Using Spiral Zetsu to locate his friends, he learned that Minato was once again absent. On his way, Obito's left eye socket caught a glimps of what his left eye was actually seeing, but dismissed it as a panic thought. Upon reaching the battlefield, he was shocked to see Kakashi had run Rin through with his Chidori.
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
As Rin died before both of them, their Sharingan matured into the Mangekyo Sharingan and Kakashi passed out quickly afterwards. The Kiri-nin attempted to claim Rin's body for intel, prompting an enraged Obito to slaughter them with a combination of his Kamui ability and Wood Release sprouting from his body. After killing all the Kiri-nin and ignoring Kakashi completely, Obito cradled Rin's body and vowed he would create a world where she was alive again.Moving the Plan Forward 
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
With new conviction, he returned to Mountains' Graveyard and agreed with Madara's conclusion that the reality they lived in was worthless and should be destroyed. He vowed he would create a new reality where he, Rin, and Kakashi would be together again. Pleased, Madara told Obito the details of the Eye of the Moon Plan, the secrets of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, and the role Nagato would play with his Rinnegan. Disconnecting himself from the Demonic Statue, Madara told Obito that until the day he was revived, he would be Madara Uchiha and must work to bring the Eye of the Moon Plan to completion.
Obito and Zetsu travelled to Amegakure to meet the Ame Orphans, who were sceptical at Obito's claim that he was Madara and his plan to make a world where everyone win despite Nagato wanting to know about his powers. Yahiko brushed Obito off and told him to stay away from them. Obito, however, stated that he would return to that spot everyday until they understood and came to him willingly. Eventually, after the death of Yahiko, Nagato would become Pain and join Obito, this beginning the current incarnation of Akatsuki.
</div>



<br>

<div class="par">
From this point, Obito's actions are largely unknown. As Tsunade speculated years later, the reason Obito adopted his name was to take advantage of the power it invoke in peoples' fears of the legend himself. Because of the many infamous acts Madara carried out during his lifetime (such as acquiring an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan), few are surprised that Madara could still be alive after such a long time. They take the crimes that Obito commits under Madara's name as further confirmation that he is really Madara, as only Madara would be capable of such deeds. Obito also possesses knowledge of things that only the real Madara would know, further giving him credence.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Twelve years before the start of the series, having infiltrated Konoha, Obito learned that Kushina Uzumaki, the Nine-Tails' jinchuriki and Minato's wife, would be giving birth. Obito knew that this would cause the seal keeping Nine-Tails contained within her to weaken. Intending to use the Nine-Tails, Obito tracked her down and took the newborn Naruto Uzumaki hostage to keep Minato from interfering. Once he extracted the beast, Obito placed the tailed beast under his control and ordered it to destroy Konoha. Using Kamui to keep Minato from going to the village's defence, keeping his true identity hidden while reaffirming his ambitions, Obito engaged Minato before being hit by a Rasengan and branded with Minato's Flying Thunder God Technique. Wounded with Minato's Contract Seal disrupting his control over the Nine-Tails, Obito fled while vowing to regain the tailed beast, and declared that he still had other plans.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Eight years after the Nine-Tails' attack, the Uchiha clan who had been ostracised and placed under heavy suspicion for the attack as the full story of the event died with Minato and his wife, Obito infiltrated Konoha to rekindle the flames of war. He was found by Itachi Uchiha first, who thought he was Madara and convinced Obito to spare the village in exchange for helping to wipe out the Uchiha clan. Obito complied, training Itachi and providing assistance. Around that time, Obito also met with Danzo Shimura. At some point in time, Obito also took control of the Fourth Mizukage, in effect making him the "real" Mizukage. Kisame Hoshigaki was one of the few Kirigakure ninja to know of his manipulation of the Fourth yet helped Obito in his quest to bring about an end to the "world of lies". Later on, Obito adopted the persona of Tobi in order to join the Akatsuki as Zetsu's subordinate to establish and hide himself among their ranks before finally putting Madara's agenda into motion.
</div>


<br><br><br>

<span class="subheadings1">
PERSONALITY
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br>

<div class="par">
In his youth, Obito was constantly late, which, more often than not, was due to the good deeds he had stopped to do, which usually had to do with aiding the elderly. Having made it a point in his life to do so, he noted that he knew all the elderly persons in Konoha, stopped once on his way to the Chunin Exams to help an elderly woman carry her luggage, and even comically offered to clean Madara's nether regions when he met him. Obito was also easily moved to tears, which he always insisted was because he had gotten something in his eyes despite wearing goggles. Obito was in love with Rin; but his feelings were not mutual as Rin was attracted to Kakashi instead. Obito was frustrated by this, and envied Kakashi's prodigious skills, and so constantly sought to surpass him. Although these efforts usually ended in failure, he was able to spend time with Rin while she treated his injuries. Ultimately, Obito would never get the chance to reveal his feelings to Rin before his "death". As Kakashi noted, besides his student's rivalry with Sasuke and one-sided feelings for a female team-mate, Naruto shared other beliefs Obito had, such as his desire to become Hokage and never abandoning comrades on the battlefield. Even after "dying", Obito still cared deeply for his friends and village, and immediately wanted to return to see them again. However, upon witnessing Kakashi taking Rin's life, Obito's determination shattered, and his personality forever changed.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
By the time he became an adult, conditioned by Madara to continue his work, Obito's personality changed drastically as he became extremely focused, calm and serious. From his former loyalty and care that seems to be derived from the Will of Fire, he now claims to have inherited the Uchiha clan's Curse of Hatred with the entire world itself as the object of his loathing. This conviction became increasingly stronger to the point of Obito no longer caring for his well being, stating he is nobody and that nothing matters to him besides the Eye of the Moon Plan. This lack of empathy includes those close to him, attacking Minato and Kakashi without hesitation if he ended up killing them as he believes once the Eye of the Moon Plan is completed he can just revive them along with Rin. Only his love for Rin remained, his desire to see her again becoming the motivation for his actions. He also became friends with Zetsu prior to his personality change, being one of his few (if not only) genuinely positive relationships.
While frequently arrogant about his own abilities and disrespectful of those he considers as weak, he is not above giving praise to his enemies, such as his former teacher Minato for being able to wound him. He has also forsaken his dream of being Hokage and ideals of camaraderie, and derided Naruto for having both qualities. This arrogance was extended towards Kakashi despite the two being former friends and companions, praising his speed while berating him not to open his mouth so easily. Although Obito does not blame Kakashi, he considers him trash like himself and anyone who has lived in the world for so long, a twist to his former belief that anyone who abandons their comrades are lower than trash. Obito has also shown an aggressive and sadistic side, not above taking the newborn Naruto hostage to release Kurama from his mother and mercilessly killing Torune in order to be reincarnated moments later by using Fu as a sacrifice, all for the purpose of testing Kabuto's abilities.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
When first introduced as "Tobi", Obito acted the role of the happy-go-lucky idiot, who annoyed most members of the Akatsuki, particularly Deidara, who frequently attacked Obito in a comedic fashion. Kisame, on the other hand, appreciated Obito's ability to brighten up a gloomy organisation such as theirs.[33] In the anime, Obito is shown keeping up this charade even when no-one was around. Eventually, Obito discards his role as a fool after Deidara's death and used it one final time to distract the Eight Man Squad during Sasuke's battle with Itachi.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Obito is a master of manipulation, either by subtly corrupting his target's own goals, omitting parts of stories or events to his own benefit as he did with Sasuke, or by appearing to share their beliefs. This is best seen in the existence of the Akatsuki, its wildly-differing members working together because they believe the organisation furthers their own ends; in actuality they are mere tools that further Obito's agenda as noted with the case of Nagato. He often avoids responsibility for the influence he has over others, claiming those he coerced and manipulated followed him willingly. He is also capable of great patience in attaining his goals, even lecturing Sasuke on it at one time. However, his patience isn't unlimited — at one point he chooses to discard caution and proceed with his plan in a more aggressive and decisive manner, and when the Ten-Tails is revived, he insists that the Eye of the Moon ritual be commenced immediately. He is also prone to taking risks — revealing Itachi's true history and motives with Sasuke to win his services was the first of many gambles Obito takes. Even though Sasuke does not always live up to his expectations, such as being unable to defeat the five Kage, Obito is nevertheless happy with his "development": his developing Sharingan and his growing isolation from all other allies. While he has threatened to kill Sasuke at times and even offered to turn him over to others, Obito remains attached to Sasuke, at least until he no longer has use for him. He was even able to take advantage of Madara by using his own necessity in Madara's ultimate ambition of becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchuriki, in order to fulfil his own desire of plunging the Shinobi Alliance into despair. After Neji's death, Obito insisted on pointing out to Naruto that he has lost many people, and that his beliefs would only lead to the deaths of all who had acknowledged him, to the point Madara noticing how Obito had become like his own past self.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Obito has also recently acquired an almost-obsessive fixation toward Naruto Uzumaki, whom reminds him of himself in his youth.[39] Because of this, Obito expresses great anger towards Naruto for continuing to follow the same ideology that he once possessed until Rin's death, and because of the similarities to himself in his youth, Obito considers Naruto incredibly naive and childish to still believe in such principles. Nonetheless, the Uchiha displayed confidence that Naruto would one day end up like him, and nearly succeeded in proving this point after having the Ten-Tails kill his comrades right before his eyes. However, after this ploy failed to change Naruto's way of thinking, Obito became rash and careless, accidentally allowing the Ten-Tails to be injured by Killer B after impulsively trying to use its power to kill more of Naruto's allies.
</div>

<span class="subheadings1">
SPECIAL SKILLS
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br><br><br>

<div class="par">
Obito was fairly skilled as a child and was able to become a chunin at the age of 11. He was able to be recognised as an adult in his clan, having mastered the Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, though he had yet to awaken his Sharingan. He was a fast learner, capable of effectively utilising advanced techniques shortly after gaining them such as the Wood Release, with Spiral Zetsu noting his potential and why Madara Uchiha had chose him. As an adult, having been trained personally by Madara, who passed on most of his skills and knowledge to the young Uchiha, Obito's abilities have developed immensely, easily allowing him to hold his own against both Kage-level and S-rank shinobi, as well as perfect jinchuriki and other highly reputed shinobi.
After his right half was reconstructed from the DNA material of Hashirama Senju, Obito was granted an immense increase in vitality and chakra reserves as a result, allowing him to achieve such feats like summoning large creatures such as the Nine-Tails, items such as the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path as well as provide him with the basis required to control six jinchuriki at once. This constant use of summons and third parties became one of two key elements in Obito's fighting style later in life.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he noted that his new mask had been specifically designed for combat, making it very durable.[48]
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Taijutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
As a child, Obito was fairly skilled with taijutsu. He had a very fast reaction time and reflexes, as he was able to get rid of a trap that was sprung on his team, though this was not always a good thing as seen when he pre-empted Might Guy's attack as a child but got knocked out instead. After awakening his Sharingan, his hand-to-hand abilities improved as he was better able to read and now even predict his opponents movements to the point that he was able to effectively counter Kakko — an experienced Iwa-nin's attacks. He also displayed skill in coordinated attacks alongside Kakashi using his Sharingan. Later on, his skill in this area saw some growth, enough to outmatch and subdue opponents such as the various Kiri-nin he fought after Rin's death or his former friend Kakashi in his adulthood. He mostly achieves this by using his hand-to-hand combat in tandem with his space-time technique to allow opponents to phase through him and then quickly counter using the elements of surprise and confusion.
Due to his artificial body, Obito's physical strength was increased significantly. He was to crack a massive boulder shortly after his rehabilitation, and in later years easily stop a slash from Suigetsu's Kubikiribocho with his artificial right arm in the manga, and his real left arm in the anime without injuring himself,  hold Konan off the ground by her throat, and strangle a Konoha ANBU to death,[56] each time using only one hand. Obito has also developed massive endurance, enough to withstand the damage caused by a direct Rasengan strike without having his movements impaired. 
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Obito has displayed a high level of speed, even without his Kamui. During his encounter with Kakko he displayed enough speed to intercept the Iwa-nin's attacks, creating an opening for Kakashi to attack. He also displayed speed against the Kirigakure ninja he fought, closing distances quickly and landing a series of swift blows and punches before any of them could react. As an adult, Obito's speed was great enough that he was able to keep up with Naruto in his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Ninjutsu 
Nature Transformation

</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
As a member of the Uchiha clan, Obito is well-versed in Fire Release techniques, which he was able to use quickly, as seen during a mission where he demonstrated in a fast use of the Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique. In the anime, Obito displayed the ability to conceal shuriken in multiple small fireballs. He has also shown the capability to combine his space-time techniques with his fire nature to create a vortex of flames known as Fire Release: Blast Wave Wild Dance.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Obito gained the ability to use Wood Release after acquiring artificial limbs created from Hashirama Senju's DNA. His skill with this kekkei genkai was shown during his assault on several Kirigakure-nin after Rin had died. When merged with Spiral Zetsu, he could use this skill to produce sharp branches from his body to impale enemies. He could use the Wood Release: Cutting Technique, which allowed him to use wood projectiles which multiplied inside a victim's body once stabbed by them. At one point he brought out massive tangled roots from ground which viciously crushed the Kiri-nin caught in-between them. Obito could also produce smaller roots from one of his arms, and use them to restrain and constrict his opponents. Using Hashirama's cells, Obito could connect and control (albeit with difficulty) a tailed beast as powerful as the Ten-Tails.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Due to his artificial body, created from Hashirama's living clone, Obito was able to replace his right arm two times and his left hand once. These constructs are expendable and replaceable as seen when Obito had his arm replaced and are similar in nature to that of White Zetsu and its clones. When damaged the area oozes a white substance instead of blood. The artificial right side also possess a degree of regenerative capabilities, as Obito's arm and shoulder seemingly managed to repair itself from the damage caused by Naruto's Rasengan. This artificial body also enables Obito to survive without the need for food or water. 
Aside from the Wood Release, Obito can presumably use its two component elements: earth and water. He has shown an aptitude with the former element as seen when he burrowed and moved underground to spread Deidara's bombs across a battlefield to create a literal minefield.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Bukijutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
As an adult, Obito has been shown wielding various weapons throughout the series. During the Fourth Shinobi World War he began carrying the war fan that Madara Uchiha was known to use during his life. Attached to the gunbai was a chain that was connected to Obito, which allows him to use his fan in a similar manner to a flail, as an alternate means of attacking, and defending, as well as a method to get within proximity to absorb his enemies. The gunbai is also extremely durable, enough to block a Rasengan without any visible damage to it.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
In his fight with Minato Namikaze, he used a long chain attached to braces on his wrist, resembling shackles. They were used in conjunction with his ability to become intangible, first by allowing the adversary to harmlessly pass through his body before solidifying once again as they emerge from the other side, restraining them with the trailing chain. Just before the Uchiha clan massacre, when meeting with Itachi, Obito was seen carrying a sword at his waist. He is also willing to use makeshift objects as weapons, as seen when he used a simple pipe to impale Konan.
Upon first activating his Mangekyo Sharingan and Wood Release, there were multiple chakra receivers among the branches that extended off his right side. Though after releasing the two techniques, the receivers seemed to vanish along with them. After implanting Nagato's Rinnegan, Obito displayed a wider use of the chakra receivers. By implanting a single chakra receiver within the left breast of the former jinchuriki, Obito was able to control and manipulate them entirely as well as force them to adopt their jinchuriki transformations at will. He also has giant stakes, used to stab enemies and produce chakra chains that can restrain a tailed beast.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Shurikenjutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
As an Uchiha, Obito is proficient in the use of shuriken techniques and wields a set of giant shuriken of varying sizes (from the size of handheld ones, to ones larger than a full-grown person) stored in the other dimension, which he can instantly bring out, by using his Kamui's spiraling distortion to launch them at a high rotational speed, which adds an element of surprise to the attack and gives the opponent minimal time to react accordingly. He also uses them as close-range melee weapons against Kakashi, for both stabbing and slashing. 
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Dojutsu 
Sharingan
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
When Obito first awakened his Sharingan it already had two tomoe and he was able to take immediate advantage of it despite his inexperience. His eye gained three tomoe after witnessing Rin's death, moments before his Mangekyo Sharingan awakened. After giving up his original left eye to Kakashi, Obito obtained a new left Sharingan eye and has multiple Sharingan placed in storage should he need them. As an adult, Obito seems to be able to keep his Sharingan active at all times with minimal drain on his chakra levels. He can use his Sharingan to perform various genjutsu such as forcing Konan to revealing the whereabouts of Nagato's body, and trapping both Fu and Torune in a genjutsu for a considerable amount of time. 
Like Madara, Obito can use his Sharingan to place tailed beasts under his control, this control being more effective on a single target, with some difficulty when controlling more than one at the same time, allowing the beasts to temporarily break free in such instances.  Obito can also perform Izanagi, a technique the Uchiha deemed a kinjutsu since the user's Sharingan is stricken with blindness and sealed away forever. While there are normally limits on how long Izanagi can remain active, Obito used Hashirama's DNA to extend the length of his Izanagi, allowing him to keep it going for five minutes while only losing one of his replacement left eyes.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Mangekyo Sharingan 
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Obito awakened his Mangekyo Sharingan after witnessing Rin's death at the hands of Kakashi.[81] The eye itself, naturally, has the same design as Kakashi's and is reminiscent of a pin-wheel. It is through his Mangekyo Sharingan that he is able to perform his space-time ninjutsu, Kamui. 
This ability grants Obito the use of two distinct abilities: teleportation, and another best described as "intangibility". The eye serves as a gateway to another dimensional space, which he can instantly send parts of his body to and bring back from. This causes him to seem "intangible" in the original dimension; when struck, attacks pass right through him, though he sometimes pretends to be hurt or cry out in pain to toy with his opponents.[88] Obito must become solid in order to interact with others, leaving him susceptible to counter-attack when he does so. He can only make himself continuously intangible for about five minutes. He can extend this intangibility to whatever he's touching at the time.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
The second part of his Kamui is to travel long distances within relatively short time-spans. While he is usually seen using this ability on himself, avoiding attacks rather than relying on his imperiousness, he can teleport anyone by making physical contact with them. Once teleported the targets are forced to stay there until he chooses to release them. The chakra signatures of those that have been teleported completely vanish as they enter another dimension. When being transported in this way, the target appears to be sucked into his right eye. Obito must remain solid while this teleportation is used, and it takes longer to absorb himself than it does someone or something else. Minato Namikaze commended Obito's space-time ninjutsu, dubbing it more versatile than both his own and Tobirama Senju's. 
He is also capable of combining his fire techniques with his Kamui technique to produce a powerful vortex of fire. He can also use his Kamui to unleash various weapons from the eye's pocket dimension at very high speeds, giving his opponents little time to react.

Overall Obito favours using his intangibility for defence, letting his opponents and their techniques phase through him and absorbing them while they are off-guard. This became such a key element in Obito's fighting style that he rarely resorts to more traditional forms of ninjutsu. The only reliable counter to this technique has been Kakashi's own Kamui, ironically used by the counterpart, left eye; objects warped away by Kamui are sent to the same dimension which can then harm the part of Obito that may exist in the other dimension at that time. However, because of the ability to warp himself and the fact that the eyes share the same dimensional void, Obito is "immune" in a sense, to Kakashi's use of this technique on him, as he can freely move between the dimensions.

Rinnegan

Following the loss of his replacement Sharingan, Obito implanted Madara's Rinnegan, taken from Nagato's corpse, into his left eye socket in preparation for the Fourth Shinobi World War. With the Rinnegan, Obito can summon the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.
Obito makes use of the Six Paths of Pain, with his particular Paths being chosen from the reincarnated jinchuriki, embedding chakra receivers in their bodies which allows him to manipulate them. Each one also has the same eyes as he does (a right Sharingan and a left Rinnegan), allowing him to see what they see and coordinate their movements. This enhances the jinchuriki's original abilities, allowing them to perform a series of collaborative and precise attacks. However, due to the immense chakra consumption, he does not have the Paths use the individual skills granted by the Six Paths Technique.

As a wielder of the Rinnegan, Obito also has access to the aforementioned Six Paths Technique. On one occasion he mentioned that he could use the Human Path technique to extract information from an individual, though the process would kill the target. He has also displayed extensive use of the Outer Path ability, where by combining it with the Demonic Statue, he was able to reseal the tailed beasts into their respective jinchuriki and use their powers freely as well as create chakra chains that he used to suppress their power. Obito is able to use the chains to drag the beasts he controls into his own body or reseal them instantly inside the Statue. He can use the Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique which can revive an individual at the cost of his own life, which he noted to be key to reviving Madara as a living individual and not a reincarnated body.
