<br>
<br>
<div class="par">
Hidden Grass is a lower shinobi village, being allied with Leaf, Rain, Sand and Waterfall. As such it participates in the Chuunin Exam with these countries. In the Chuunin Exam Naruto participated in, no Grass team made it beyond the second exam test. The Genin team from Grass who made it to the second Chuunin Exam test is most noteworthy for being killed and impersonated by Orochimaru as he infiltrated the exam. Also of note is Orochimaru's sword Kusanagi (Grass Cutter), it is unknown if this blade has any ties to the country or village.

The Grass country contains some of the more widely varried landscapes in the series, with forests, grasslands, mountains, rivers and bamboo thickets dotting it. The country shares borders with Earth, Fire, Rain and Waterfall. Because the country lies between Earth and Fire, it has been in invaded by the Earth Country during previous ninja wars. To avoid Earth gaining a foothold next to the Fire Country border, many Leaf ninja came to Hidden Grass's aid during the war. This resulted in many skimishes taking place within its borders.</div>
