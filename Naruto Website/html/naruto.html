<span class="subheadings1">BACKGROUND</span>

<hr size="3" color="#0000ff" width="100%">

<br>

<div class="par">

Naruto was born as the son of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, and Kurama's second jinchuriki, Kushina Uzumaki. Naruto's parents named him after the main character of Jiraiya's first book, thus making the Sannin his godfather. Prior to Naruto's birth, his parents and the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi feared that his birth would break the seal which kept Kurama in Kushina. The plan to ensure it did not occur was for Kushina to be taken to top-secret location outside the village with with Biwako Sarutobi and Taji as her midwives, a few ANBU as security, and Minato to keep the seal in place. However, word of Kushina giving birth reached a masked ninja who intended to take the Nine-Tails for his own evil ends. Killing the midwives and ANBU, the masked man took the newborn Naruto hostage to keep Minato steps away from Kushina so the seal can be shattered.

<span class="subheadings2">Naruto as a child</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Despite Minato's final request to Hiruzen for the villagers to see Naruto as a hero who had helped defeat Kurama, only the Third Hokage and a few of the villagers honoured his request. Everyone else instead resented him for containing the monster that had destroyed their home, some even seeing him as the Nine-Tails itself. Furthermore, Hiruzen created the decreed to prohibit any mention of Naruto's nature as a jinchuriki in the hope that the other children would not resent him. However, even without knowing the reason, most of the children followed their parents' example and ostracised Naruto. The social isolation would cause Naruto to develop a need to be acknowledged through mischief.

</div>

<span class="subheadings2">Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry during their childhood</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

When Naruto was enrolled into the Academy, he became the student of Iruka Umino and met his class mate Sasuke Uchiha when the two were pair to spar against each other. Though excited at the chance to achieve popularity by beating Sasuke, Naruto was easily beaten. By looking at Sasuke's eyes, Naruto realised that they were filled with hatred. When Iruka told them to make the reconciliation seal, they both refused. Since then, Naruto came to see Sasuke as a rival and intended to beat him. When Naruto found out that Sasuke was also an orphan, he was secretly happy for not being the only one alone and wanted to talk to him, but couldn't because of his jealousy toward Sasuke's skills. Still, Naruto wished that, someday, Sasuke would acknowledge him as an equal.

</div>


<br>

<div class="par">

In the anime, when Naruto pulled a prank on a group of boys for not being invited to their "test of courage", he refused to return to the Academy after being glared by Iruka with the same resentful stare everyone else gives him. Later, Naruto is tricked by the boys' leader, Hibachi, to get himself killed by enemy ninja in the hills.Learning of this, Iruka ends up saving Naruto from a trio Takigakure kunochi before Kakashi Hatake dispatches their pursuers.Soon after, Naruto begins attending class again at the time that Iruka, who now acts as a surrogate brother to keep the boy in line, gave a lecture on the Will of Fire that inspires Naruto to become the next Hokage someday to achieve the acknowledgement he is striving for. Apart from Hiruzen and Iruka, Naruto also found a surrogate family with the owner of Ramen Ichiraku: Teuchi and his daughter Ayame to some extent.
</div>
<br><br>

<div class="par">
Being a descendant of the Uzumaki clan, Naruto inherited an incredibly strong life-force. This gives him extraordinary stamina and vitality, and by extension, an equally long potential lifespan, which enabled him to survive the cell-destroying effects of Kurama's hatred within its chakra several times. </div>

<span class="subheadings1">PERSONALITY</span>

<hr size="3" color="#0000ff" width="100%">

<br>

<div class="par">

Naruto is exuberant, brash, inattentive, and heedless to formality or social standings. He inherited his catch-phrase "Dattebayo!" from his mother, who would say "(da)ttebane" when excited or frustrated.
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">
 Naruto has a number of childish traits, like keeping his money in a chubby, green-frog wallet he affectionately calls "Gama-chan", being a very picky eater (he almost exclusively eats ramen and is a frequent customer at the Ramen Ichiraku), and being afraid of ghosts.
He is also somewhat perverted, something he tends to be reprimanded for by Sakura Haruno and Iruka, but has only become even more so after meeting his mentor Jiraiya, causing many to say that Jiraiya raised a perfect replica of himself.
However, whenever someone dear to him is in trouble or the situation calls for it, Naruto can be very serious, and will instantly try to come to their aid.
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

According to Kakashi, Naruto learns through his body, as he is relatively naive, simple, and being slow to understand a principle or situation, which often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp what is being explained to him. Overall, Naruto responds best to competition and has a great deal of self-confidence, loudly proclaiming that he will master whatever technique he is learning within a fraction of the usual time, though he doesn't hesitate to ask for help if he needs it. While as naive as he appears to be throughout most of the series, Naruto has proven to have a keen eye to certain things most people don't see, showing that he can be smarter than what most people, especially Sakura, are willing to give him credit for when he wants to be, something even Choji comments on once in a while. This was shown when Naruto was the first to notice the differences in Sai's book, later helped to decipher Jiraiya's dying message left from Fukasaku on his back and managed to help solve the message through Kakashi's Icha Icha book. He is also quite observant in regards to other people's feelings (though he was oblivious of Hinata's love for him until she confessed her feelings to him) and is able to perceive the truth from people's intentions, such as when Sakura claimed she loved him and not Sasuke any more, Naruto immediately knew she was lying about how she felt, having witnessed her most extreme and inimitable signs of love for Sasuke. Naruto also saw through Iruka's lie about another creature on the Island Turtle they were on from remembering Motoi's talk about B taming all the animals on the island.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Due to the prejudice and loneliness he suffered in his childhood, Naruto developed a craving for acknowledgement. In order to achieve this, Naruto would pull pranks all around the village and even going far as strive for the title of Hokage. Even after graduating from the academy, Naruto was still determined to be recognised, but as he made more and more connections with others, his reasons for wanting to become Hokage underwent a change, having less to do with the desire for recognition, and more to do with wanting the strength to protect his home and the people close to him. As noted by Tobi, Naruto possessed the Will of Fire, likening him to Hashirama Senju in this aspect. Naruto's determination and drive strongly impacts the lives of those around him, even his enemies have been affected by his empathy. Both Kakashi and Temari referred to Naruto's amazing charisma as a "unique power" that allows him to change the worldly views of others for the better. Son Goku also thought of him as an open and honest person. Like Guy and Rock Lee, when Naruto makes a promise, he assumes the "nice guy pose" and becomes dedicated to fulfilling it.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Sasuke's defection shocked Naruto to his core, but he never wavered in his resolve to bring him back to Konoha. When his teacher Jiraiya was killed in battle by the Akatsuki leader Pain, he vowed vengeance against the man and left Konoha for a time to train in senjutsu. Upon returning home after Pain destroyed the village and succumbing to rage, he met and spoke with his father, Minato Namikaze, who explained to him the cycle of hatred and entrusted him with the duty of saving the ninja world from its hate. After listening to Nagato's story of how hatred can shape a person and the world into darkness, Naruto vowed he would end the cycle of hatred and bring peace to the ninja world, and later displays a more levelheaded, thoughtful and diplomatic approach from that moment onward. This decision however would come in direct opposition in his quest to bring Sasuke home, something that at first depressed him deeply. However after meeting again in the Land of Iron, Naruto resolved that if he had to, he would fight and potentially kill his friend to end the cycle of hatred and save Sasuke from despair, even if it costs his own life.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

When he discovered that the Fourth Shinobi World War had started, Naruto made it his mission to end the war all by himself, so no one else would suffer. He continued to do so until his battle with the reincarnated Nagato and Itachi Uchiha. After the fight, even though Itachi acknowledged Naruto had become stronger, he explained to Naruto that if he continued to believe that he could do everything alone, he would become arrogant like Madara. Itachi also said that if Naruto were to become Hokage, he should never forget his friends or do everything on his own. Afterwards, Naruto acknowledged his shortcomings in his attempts to do things himself and allowed others to help him, instead of shouldering burdens himself.

</div>

<br><br><br>

<span class="subheadings1">SPECIAL SKILLS:</span>

<hr size="3" color="#0000ff" width="100%">

<br>

<div class="par">

At the start of the series, Naruto's ninja skills were either average or sub-par, as seen from his inept ability to perform a basic Clone Technique. One of the only techniques he could do without fail was the Transformation Technique, and his own original variant of the technique called the Sexy Technique; a creative, but almost completely useless diversionary technique. Throughout Part I, he learns a number of short-range techniques, which are expanded upon during his two-and-a-half years of training with Jiraiya. Naruto also improves his knowledge of other ninja skills while under Jiraiya's tutelage, using more taijutsu and shurikenjutsu than he did in Part I. He also learned how to dispel genjutsu and despite his limited skill with it he was able to resist being put to sleep by Itachi Uchiha, a genjutsu master. During Part II, he starts to master longer-range techniques, such as the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken and the Tailed Beast Ball.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

In Part I, Naruto was regularly noted to have a great deal of potential by among some of the strongest ninja like Kakashi, Kabuto, even the Sannin, proving himself as a very late bloomer. Iruka remarked that Naruto could surpass all of the other previous Hokage when he saw him use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. When Orochimaru saw him defeat Kabuto, he tried to kill Naruto for fear of what he would become. Much of this potential manifests itself during Part II, regularly proving himself a match for the S-rank members of Akatsuki. His victory over Nagato's Six Paths of Pain has earned him great accolade in the ninja world: Konoha villagers now even believe he is Hokage material after they hear about it, thereby earning status on par with other renown ninja within Konoha. Zetsu, after seeing the battle, even suggests that Naruto has become stronger than Sasuke, who also showed similar improvement against Akatsuki members. Naruto also gained the acknowledgement of other immensely powerful individuals such as Kurama and even Madara Uchiha. With further training and control of Kurama's power, he is even able to hold his own against Kage of both the previous, and current generation on the battlefield.
During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto received some chakra from the other tailed beasts, excluding Shukaku and Gyuki; the effects of these gifts are currently unknown.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Chakra Prowess</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Being a descendant of the Uzumaki clan, Naruto inherited an incredibly strong life-force. This gives him extraordinary stamina and vitality, and by extension, an equally long potential lifespan, which enabled him to survive the cell-destroying effects of Kurama's hatred within its chakra several times. Kurama has even noted that Naruto is the only one capable of using its chakra properly since he's an Uzumaki and the fact that he's been a jinchuriki his whole life. Despite his young age, Naruto has been repeatedly noted to have a massive chakra reserve, to which Kakashi, estimated it to be at least four times greater than his own during their initial missions together as Team 7. As Naruto grew older, his reserves increased greatly, reaching the point where he could undergo senjutsu training and enter Sage Mode. Additionally, his chakra was described by Karin to be warm and bright, exactly opposite to Sasuke's.

</div>

<br>

<span class="subheadings2">Jinchuriki Transformations:</span><br>
<span class="subheadings2" style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18px">Main article: Naruto Uzumaki's Jinchuriki Forms</span>

<br><br>

<div class="par">

As Kurama's jinchuriki, Naruto's chakra reserve is greatly enhanced to enormous levels, which Kakashi estimated to be about a hundred times greater than his own when its influence is not suppressed. It also gives Naruto accelerated healing (recovering from minor injuries within seconds and major injuries within a day). Also, depending on the amount of Kurama's chakra he's using, Naruto is given an increase in strength, speed, and his healing factor are pushed to such levels that he completely recovered from a Chidori through his chest in mere moments with no lingering signs of injury. At times, he is also granted a fox-shaped chakra shroud with massive invulnerability, being able to resist being pierced by Orochimaru's Sword of Kusanagi, a sword known as being able to cut through adamantine, and is completely undamaged by the alkali substance excreted by Saiken, which was able to damage Gyuki and disintegrate its surroundings rapidly.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

The seal had allowed a small amount of Kurama's chakra to always mix with Naruto's own. In Part I, Jiraiya once stated that Naruto's body was much too small a vessel to properly contain Kurama's overwhelming chakra, and his body would instinctively reject the bulk of it due to the damage it could cause. Both Kakashi and Ebisu also implied that Naruto's poor chakra control stemmed from this, as a portion of his chakra was used in attempt to suppress Kurama's own.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Kurama's chakra first came to Naruto during life-threatening situations, given to him by the fox itself to ensure its survival, but after training with Jiraiya, Naruto learned how to contact Kurama and demand some of its chakra. Alternatively, Naruto could give into his anger or frustration, allowing Kurama to force its influence upon him. Depending on how much he gained, Kurama's influence within its chakra could make Naruto lose control of his senses, devolving into an animal that attacks anything within reach, as well as damaging his own body, slowly shortening his lifespan. Although a number of methods had been devised to break its influence over Naruto (Jiraiya's seal tag, and Yamato's Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands, which was facilitated by Hashirama Senju's necklace Naruto wore before its destruction), Naruto simply limited his use of Kurama's chakra, and tried not to allow his anger get the better of him, but he eventually attempted to exercise more control over it, in which he was able to achieve during the Fourth Shinobi World War.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

The Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is a form that Naruto gained after he separated and sealed Kurama from its chakra. In this form, Naruto exhibits exceptional speed and strength. Like his predecessor, Mito Uzumaki, Naruto also gains Kurama's ability to sense negative emotions, something that not even the best sensor-type ninja can do. Naruto can even use the shroud to create chakra arms that he can use for greater range of attacks as well as giving him greater dexterity and manoeuvrability to his fighting style without the use of shadow clones. The power of his techniques become so great that unless they already have some inherent durability, like the Third Raikage, reincarnated shinobi have a hard time regenerating.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Naruto eventually gained Kurama's cooperation and has access to its full powers, becoming one of the rare individuals, jinchuriki or otherwise, to succeed having complete control over the tailed beast's power. When they meld their chakra together, Naruto is able to enter Tailed Beast Mode as he gains access to a new chakra shroud as well as the ability to create a tailed beast-cloak both of which forms has shown feats of tremendous speed and power. He can release a powerful shock-wave that is strong enough to knock back five fully transformed tailed beasts at once. He is also able to use the Tailed Beast Ball himself. His skill with the Tailed Beast Ball is high enough that he could aim it perfectly at the bottom of the combined Tailed Beast Ball Tobi's controlled beasts made to send both flying into the air and explode. He could also use his tails as chakra arms, making a Nine-Tails Chakra Mode shadow clone in each to attack multiple targets at once. Also like Killer B and Gyuki, Naruto can perform a barrage of Tailed Beast Balls at a single target. In this form, Naruto can perform partial transformations, such as manifesting a giant chakra arm or Kurama's head to block an attack or to fire a Tailed Beast Ball.

</div>

<br>


<span class="subheadings2">Ninjutsu:</span><br>
<span class="subheadings2" style="font-weight:normal;font-size:18px">Shadow Clone Technique</span> 

<br><br>

<div class="par">

Although Naruto had trouble with the Clone Technique at the start of the series, he quickly learned how to use jonin-level techniques, like the Shadow Clone Technique and its large-scale version. The technique would become his first signature technique, one of the two foundations of his ninjutsu, and later, the base of his training skills. The Shadow Clone Technique takes advantage of the massive chakra reserve Naruto possesses due to him being Kurama's jinchuriki. Naruto is able to create upwards of a thousand clones, and retain a decent amount of chakra in each of them. Because of this, Naruto can use his shadow clones for virtually anything, from straight combat to speed training. After the timeskip, Kakashi has noted that Naruto's timing with the technique has improved drastically.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Initially, Naruto would create a multitude of clones to overwhelm his opponents. Other times, however, he would employ the use of the Transformation Technique to change the appearance of these clones to catch his target off guard. By Part II, Naruto learned that whatever his shadow clones learn, he, the main mind, would also learn. By using this, he is able to learn techniques that would usually take months or years in days, which speeds up his training greatly. Naruto takes advantage of this often, using shadow clones to determine his opponents' abilities, to determine how many clones he will really need to defeat them instead of simply wasting chakra on thousands of clones.

</div>

<br>

<div class="par">

Despite the risks of Naruto's chakra being drained faster by Kurama whenever he uses the Shadow Clone Technique while in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto did use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to scatter throughout the battlefield, although he didn't create as many as he normally does. His relationship with Kurama has improved since them, allowing Naruto to create clones in Tailed Beast Mode without having his chakra drained. Naruto also uses his shadow clones in a more innovative way so that he can access his various modes such as Sage Mode and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode along with their respective abilities simultaneously through his clones.
