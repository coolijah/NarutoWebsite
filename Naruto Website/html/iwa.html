    Iwagakure, also known as the Hidden Stone Village, is the shinobi village of the Land of Earth and is one of the five great shinobi villages. Its ninjas specialize in earth jutsus and are famous for their camouflage techniques which can make them practically invisible.  Little else is known about them, except that they gave a deep rivalry against Leaf ninjas, having fought against them in several conflicts in the past. The last great battle took place approximately 16 years ago during in the Great Shinobi war.  Iwagakure was defeated by the Leaf, but to this day there are rumors that they still plan to seek revenge.</div>
