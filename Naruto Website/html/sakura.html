BACKGROUND
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">

<br>
<div class="par">
During her early years in the Academy, Sakura was frequently bullied by others due to her large forehead. To try and combat this, Sakura used her bangs to hide her forehead, fuelling the other kids' teasing by indicating she was sensitive about it. Ino Yamanaka, realising this, helped Sakura by giving her a red ribbon that she used as a way of drawing attention to the cuter features of her forehead, which helped Sakura overcome her insecurity. The two became best friends and Sakura grew more confident, developing her own unique personality under Ino's guidance. Despite this, Sakura felt that she was living in Ino's shadow and longed to prove herself as Ino's equal. Later, when Sakura found out that Ino also had a crush on Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura ended their friendship so that they could compete for Sasuke's love, thus beginning a bitter rivalry between the two.

<span class="subheadings1">
PERSONALITY
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br>

<div class="par">
Sakura is naturally hot-headed, overbearing, stern and irritable, and because of that temperamental mindset, she tends hit people out of explosive anger and rage on more than one occasion (the victim usually being Naruto Uzumaki, Rock Lee when he flirts, and Sai), and somewhat hypercritical, along with being easily impulsive and stubborn, but most of the time, she is relatively kind, cheerful, and rational. In the anime, Sakura has been shown to be a bit of a flirt and uses this to her advantage: with one such case being when Naruto asked her out for dinner, though she only agreed if he paid for her half as well. She also prefers to speak formally, very reliant on approaches of theory and principle and tends to be a heavy and calculating thinker when it comes to details on almost any matter and very analytic when on or off the job, but she is also capable of being very naive and narrow-minded on certain matters such as Naruto's feelings for her, which went unnoticed until Sai stated it to her or when she tried to force herself to kill Sasuke twice, despite the fact that her heart wouldn't allow her to do it, leaving her vulnerable for Sasuke's attempts on her life, even her attempt to lie to Naruto about loving him instead of Sasuke, ignorant of the fact that Naruto personally witnesses Sakura's most extreme and inimitable signs of love for Sasuke.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Sakura has shown to be strong-willed and determined, not one to lose or give up in a fight easily most prominently seen during her fight with Sasori where despite being told to run by Chiyo, she stayed and fought, though even she admitted that her mental fortitude pales severely in comparison to Naruto, which is why she decided to leave the situation with Sasuke solely up to him after failing at it herself. In addition, she has a very strong need to be useful, and is often easily frustrated with herself for being a burden and not being helpful, often having to rely on either Naruto and Sasuke for help in Part I. One of her greatest regrets was relying solely on Naruto to bring Sasuke back, burdening him with the promise while she couldn't do anything but cry. It was with that resolve that she sought apprenticeship from Tsunade and since training with her, Sakura has improved, but still frets over her ability to only help others in one way.
</div>
<br>

<div class="par">
Unlike the rest of Team 7, Sakura has not suffered any great losses during her childhood. Therefore, Sakura took for granted things that her team-mates desired such as family, friends — and especially in Naruto's case — recognition. However, when she was chided for this by Sasuke, she began attempting to be more understanding of Naruto especially, and the way he acted.

<br>
<div class="par">
At the start of the series, Sakura had a deep infatuation for Sasuke Uchiha, rooted in his good looks, cunning, cool attitude, and prodigious talents. For that reason, many of Sakura's early appearances were dedicated to her continuing efforts to win his affection. As the story progressed, she began to recognise Sasuke as a real person with imperfections, and developed a more sincere desire to be there for him and later fell in love with him. Sakura also became concerned that Sasuke will someday abandon her and the rest of Konoha in his quest for power. When her fears came true at the end of Part I, Sakura did all that she could to stop Sasuke from leaving, such as professing her love for him and offering to join him. Despite thanking her and sounding grateful, Sasuke knocked Sakura unconscious and left the village.[7]
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Since then, Sakura has made it her personal goal to bring Sasuke home. Although she still worries about his well-being, Sakura is willing to attack him if it means returning him to Konoha, however, as time goes on and Sasuke becomes an increasingly more dangerous criminal, Sakura recognises that Sasuke must be stopped at all costs. Despite agreeing that they had no choice but to kill Sasuke themselves to prevent Konoha from being involved in a war by his criminal actions or his death at a foreign country's hand, Sakura was immensely saddened and distraught at the notion nonetheless to the point where it drove her into trying to take care of the Sasuke situation by herself, showing with her making the rest of Konoha 11 promise to let her be the only one who talks to Naruto while it was her plan from the start to not tell him, along with planning to knock-out her hunt group when getting close to Sasuke despite promising that they would do it together. Later on, she told Naruto that she no longer has any feelings for Sasuke since he just keeps breaking her heart and states that she loves him instead, though Naruto and most of the observers knew that she was lying and suspected that Sakura was hiding something. Her team-mate Sai at the time even commented that she was still in love with Sasuke, which is later proven to be true, and that she wants to kill him by herself so that he does not sink any lower. Upon meeting Sasuke once again, Sakura becomes upset by how corrupted Sasuke has become and tries to kill him. She ultimately realises that she lacked the resolve to carry out the action, being brought to tears as she started remembering all they went through together as members of Team 7 which caused herself to be left wide open for Sasuke's nearly successful and fatal counter-attacks. She has since come to accept that Naruto is the only one who can do anything about Sasuke with a stable, strong and clear resolve. Though she is deeply saddened by what Sasuke has become, it is shown when he is mentioned that she is still in love with him nonetheless.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Sakura's relationship with Naruto, like with Sasuke, also changes throughout the series. When they first became a team, she held contempt towards him, going as far as to insult or degrade him at any chance she got, and even stated that the one thing she does not like was Naruto (mainly because he interfered with her attempts to gain Sasuke's affections and for being a constant nuisance at the time ). However, as the series progressed, Sakura realised that her negative views of him were wrong as Naruto continuously showed his worth as a ninja as well as his dedication to his team-mates. After the Chunin Exams and missions, Sakura realises that Naruto is getting stronger and envies him, so she decides to train harder. After Sasuke defected from Konoha, Sakura pleads to Naruto, believing him to be the only one capable of bringing Sasuke back. When Naruto promises to bring Sasuke back to Konoha, Sakura realises just how committed Naruto is to her happiness, and how he has always been there for her. However, Naruto fails and is left in the hospital after losing to Sasuke, though he vows to someday fulfil the promise he made to her. Realising the lengths Naruto will go to for her, and inspired by his determination, Sakura spends the next three years training with Tsunade so that in the future she can join Naruto in his quest to bring Sasuke back.

<div class="par">
In Part II, Sakura learns of the various hardships Naruto faced with the Nine-Tails and Akatsuki. Saddened by the impact both forces have had on his life, Sakura becomes protective of Naruto and tries to do whatever she can to help him overcome these obstacles. Sakura begins to empathise with Naruto, and develops a deep friendship with him, due to their spending a lot of time together, even though there are times where she lies to him about certain things, particularly involving Sasuke in a way, along with her hyper criticism still going strong. Despite her criticism, she has developed great fondness towards him and often worries over his well-being. Later, Sai explains to her just how deep Naruto's love for her truly is, and the level of pain that trying to fulfil his promise has caused, filling Sakura with guilt and regret, ultimately resolving to take care of Sasuke by herself. After the events of the Five Kage Summit, she confesses to Naruto that she loves him, no longer caring about Sasuke, and tries to get him to give up on his promise, an attempt to ease his pain over the promise. However, Naruto does not believe her, and claims she is lying to herself, stating he knows her better than that. Sai later confirms this, and tells Naruto and his group about the ulterior motives of Sakura's confession, stating that it was actually an attempt to release the promise Naruto made for her and distract him while she and her group hunt down and kill Sasuke. Despite this cruel emotional manipulation on her part, Sai, from his perspective as a member of Root, explains that she was only thinking about Naruto's feelings, which is why she refused to tell him the truth about Sasuke being killed, as she knew full-well how much pain that would cause him, although Kiba and Lee thought that Sakura needs to have more faith in Naruto's mental endurance and believes that it would have been a better idea to just tell him the truth. Although she is now aware that Naruto loves her, Sakura while still caring for him as a close friend and team-mate, does not reciprocate these feelings for him as they are ultimately one-sided on Naruto's part. Even when she told Naruto that she loved him and she no longer had any feelings for Sasuke, Naruto wasn't fooled by Sakura's "confession", and knew all too-well that she was lying and that despite the heinous acts Sasuke committed, resulting in him to becoming an international criminal, she was in love with him nonetheless, a fact proven to be true by Sai, and later on by Sakura herself while on her way to face Sasuke in the Land of Iron and during the war.

<div class="subheadings2">
Inner Sakura
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Within Sakura resides "Inner Sakura" (??????, Uchi Naru Sakura), a manifestation of her inner emotions. In addition to comic relief, Inner Sakura represents Sakura's actual opinion on things when she outwardly displays something opposite. For example, when Naruto played a prank on Kakashi, Sakura outwardly deemed it "childish", but in the inside she enjoyed it. Inner Sakura's appearances are typically marked by an exclamation of "Shannaro!" (???????). The phrase has no literal meaning, but is usually translated as "Hell yeah!", "Hell no!", or "Damn it!", depending on the situation. The English anime, for censorship reasons, replaced the aforementioned phrases with a forceful "Cha!". Inner Sakura is unique as it is in a way a second will within Sakura's mind. When Ino used the Mind Body Switch Technique on her, Inner Sakura was able to repel the user from her body, suggesting that Sakura has a split personality, consisting of the "Inner Sakura" and her normal personality.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Although she appears quite frequently at the start of the series, Inner Sakura all but disappears midway through Part I, her only other subsequent appearance being at the start of Part II. Sakura, likewise, now performs the emotional, violent outbursts she once relied on Inner Sakura for, much to the dismay of those who are around her at the time (typically Naruto).
</div>

<span class="subheadings1">
SPECIAL SKILLS
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br><br><br>

<div class="par">
At the start of the series, Sakura's abilities as a ninja were considerably less than those of her team-mates; Sasuke and Naruto, with her greatest strength being her intelligence. After two-and-a-half years of training with Tsunade however, Sakura's abilities greatly increased to the point that she could hold her own against powerful enemies such as Sasori. Her skills in other areas have also increased, such as being able to locate Kakashi during the second bell test — something Naruto could not do — as well as tricking Sai, Kiba, and Lee into fighting each other so that she put them all to sleep. Along with physical abilities, Sakura has also inherited her master's resilience and contempt for losing. This was best displayed after she had been surrounded by a cloud of poison, and used an explosive tag to dispel the cloud of smoke without sustaining much damage herself.
</div>
<br>

<div class="par">
Due to her excellent chakra control, Sakura has been noted to have a natural aptitude for genjutsu, though so far she has only been seen dispelling illusions rather than use them. It does seem however that she has put these skill towards medical ninjutsu instead.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Chakra Control
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Soon after the start of their first mission, Sakura discovered that she had an excellent control over her chakra, and as such she had an innate ability to use techniques to their maximum efficiency without wasting any chakra. Kakashi pointed out that her ability to gather chakra from every part of the body and then using it with great timing made her superior to her team-mates in that respect. While this particular ability was never put to great use in Part I, her chakra control became a focal point of Sakura's fighting style and medical abilities in Part II.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Medical Ninjutsu
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">
Sakura's naturally refined control of her chakra had been taken to new heights over the time skip, an ability utilised to its fullest by the training she had done with Tsunade. With her excellent chakra control, Sakura had turned into an excellent combat medical-nin, and had shown herself to be able to heal fatal injuries with relatively little effort, even when more experienced medics would deem it a lost cause. She also has shown extensive knowledge of poisons having been taught by her senior pupil Shizune — learning how to imbue weapons such as kunai, with poison. She also has an extensive knowledge of herbal medicines, surpassing even the knowledge of Chiyo as well as other chemicals such as powerful sleeping gases taught to her by Tsunade.Her knowledge was great enough to withdraw Sasori's advanced poison directly from Kankuro's body, and use that as a base template to create multiple antidotes swiftly afterwards. During her fight with Sasori, she was able to start healing herself even with a poisoned sword still lodged in her abdomen.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
At the end of Part I when Tsunade observed Sakura successfully heal a fish with the Mystical Palm Technique, Tsunade remarked that Sakura had come so far, and she hadn't seen such talent since Shizune. Sakura can also assist with autopsies, as seen when she and Shizune performed an autopsy on a White Zetsu during the Fourth Shinobi World War, and she has knowledge of cells and DNA. A few individuals have even commented that Sakura has the potential to one day rival Tsunade in terms of medical skill, and perhaps even surpass her given enough time,though Sakura has stated that Tsunade's skills are far greater than her own.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Taijutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Although not known for her strength in Part I, Sakura was still strong enough to knock Ino several metres backwards with only a single strike during their match in the Chunin Exams. In the anime, during a mission to the Land of Tea, she was seen breaking off the mast of a ship and using the large log of wood as a weapon.
</div>
<br>

<div class="par">
In Part II, Sakura's taijutsu skills have seen tremendous growth thanks to Tsunade's training. By building up and releasing her chakra with precise timing, Sakura could easily demolish any obstacle and turn it to rubble. An opponent struck by her full strength could suffer blunt force trauma resulting in broken bones, ruptured organs, or even death. Through repeated use, Sakura no longer needs to put any conscious effort into using this strength, and so can use it instantly. Her strength, coupled with her medical expertise and the beauty she gained over the time skip, had caused many to see Sakura as a younger version of Tsunade, or even someone who could even surpass Tsunade. However, while Sakura's strength derives from this technique, Tsunade has been noted to possess incredible raw strength much greater than this ability, which is enhanced even further to monstrous levels when using it. This strength was great enough to completely immobilise a White Zetsu, which are extremely durable, with just one blow.
</div>
<br>

<div class="par">
Another key component of Sakura's taijutsu is her evasive skill. As a field medic, she cannot afford to be gravely injured or killed on the battle field, as drilled into her by Tsunade when she trained her. Sakura would attempt to read an opponent's fighting style in order to find the dominant hand/foot or anything that the enemy was using. With that, she could increase her evasive skill to impressive levels. Sakura was proficient enough in this that she could figure out Sasori's finger movements and predict the movements of his puppets. Her skill in evasion is so great that she can defeat one-hundred puppets without even being scratched. Although Chiyo aided Sakura in this occasion, she notes that Sakura hardly needed any help.
