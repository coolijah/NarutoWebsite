BACKGROUND
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br>

<div class="par">
Before the era of ninja villages, Madara and his younger brother, Izuna, were considered the most gifted members of the Uchiha clan. Even by his clan's standards, Madara's chakra was especially strong.He grew up constantly competing and training with Izuna and in their efforts to surpass each other, each awakened their Mangekyo Sharingan. With the power of the Mangekyo, the two brothers took control of the clan, with Madara becoming its leader. Under his leadership, the clan conquered all they came across.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par"> 
Because of the never-ending series of battles at the time, Madara eventually began to suffer from overuse of the Mangekyo Sharingan, leaving him blind. In order to regain his sight he took Izuna's eyes for himself, granting him an "eternal" Mangekyo Sharingan with which he led the Uchiha clan to prosperity. While Itachi claimed that Madara took Izuna's eyes without his consent,Tobi, while retelling this event to Sasuke, stated that Izuna willingly gave up his eyes to Madara for the good of his brother and clan.It is unknown which is true.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Over the years, the Uchiha had constantly fought with the equally powerful Senju clan and as such, Madara had an undying rivalry with Hashirama Senju, the leader of the Senju clan.To bring an end to the constant fighting, Hashirama approached the Uchiha with an offer of peace. Although Madara never wanted peace with the Senju, the rest of the Uchiha wished to end the fighting, and Madara had no choice but to accept.The Senju, the Uchiha, and all the clans they had conquered came together to form the village of Konohagakure.Some time later, the villagers of Konoha selected Hashirama as the village's first Hokage, prompting Madara to contest him for the position.During the time he was a shinobi of Konohagakure, Madara approached Mu and Onoki where he informed them that despite the alliance that Iwagakure had made with Konoha, his village was to remain the dominant power and that from that point on, they would obey Konoha.Afterwards, Madara fought and defeated them when they engaged him in battle.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
After realising that he would not be able to replace Hashirama as Hokage, Madara began to fear that Hashirama would begin to oppress the Uchiha and tried to rally support for challenging his leadership. Rather than help him, however, the Uchiha turned their backs on Madara, believing he only desired to rekindle the flames of war.Abandoned by his clan, Madara left the village, sought out Kurama, and subdued it using his Sharingan.He later returned in order to challenge Hashirama in battle. They fought at the site that would someday be called the Valley of the End, where Madara was beaten, despite controlling Kurama and having it at his side. Possession of Kurama was ultimately taken from him by Hashirama's wife, Mito, and Madara was believed to have died.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
In spite of this, Madara was able to survive the battle and go into hiding. He then used Hashirama's DNA, which he had acquired on the battlefield, and transplanted it into his wounds.Though he noted that nothing happened at first, when he was nearing the end of his natural lifespan, he awakened the Rinnegan.He also acquired the Wood Release kekkei genkai,and with both Senju and Uchiha DNA — the ability to summon the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. He later transplanted his Rinnegan eyes into Nagato without the young man knowing,and replaced his left eye with a spare Sharingan.When he met Obito years later, Madara had been reduced to using the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path as a life support system, constantly being supplied chakra by it or else he would die immediately.Also from the stolen cells of Hashirama, Madara used the statue to cultivate a living clone of Hashirama.
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
During the Third Shinobi World War, he saved Obito Uchiha after the battle of Kannabi Bridge, using artificial mass to replace the destroyed half of Obito's body.He told Obito that he would have to repay his debt to him slowly.Madara then left White Zetsu and a spiral-patterned clone with the task of guarding Obito and helping him with his rehabilitation, so he could be useful to him by the time he woke up.
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">
After Obito returned to him as he had predicted, Madara, now certain that Obito was sincere, carried him into a genjutsu and told him about the Sage of the Six Paths and the Ten-Tails. He then explained how he had awakened the Rinnegan, gained access to the empty shell of the Ten-Tails, and cultivated Hashirama's cells. He would go on to teach him various Uchiha kinjutsu, those of the Rinnegan and Yin–Yang Release. Before passing, Madara also created Black Zetsu by pouring his will into White Zetsu and also left part of his will in the chakra receiver which extends from the statue's navel. With that, Madara disconnected himself from the statue and, with his dying breath, told Obito to go and, until the time he was revived, he was to act under his name.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Fulfilling the legendary Uchiha's request, Obito, later known as "Tobi", began operating under his name while concealing his face. Due to his first-hand knowledge of Madara's actions and deeds, other shinobi were led to believe he was in fact the legendary ninja himself. However, thanks to researching the matter with Orochimaru, Kabuto Yakushi learned the truth behind Madara's time after the Valley of the End and actual death, reincarnating the ninja to blackmail Tobi into letting him aid him during the Fourth Great Shinobi World War where Kabuto partly exposed Tobi's deception.
</div>

<span class="subheadings1">
PERSONALITY
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br>

<div class="par">
Madara was a very confident and prideful man, witnessed in his belittlement of Onoki both after his reincarnation and in the past,in his berating of Mei Terumi's technique,in the fact he uses relatively weaker attacks in his arsenal initially and works his way up to his more powerful techniques when the situation requires it and the fact he believes that using more powerful techniques more than once in a battle would be disgraceful.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Conversely, he isn't above praising the abilities of others as he openly called both Mei and A's abilities an impressive offence, and Gaara and Onoki's manoeuvre an impressive defence,also commending the two being able to stop his first meteorite, as well as commending Naruto for countering his Wood Release attack. Having respect for Naruto, Madara tried to reason with him that the Eye of the Moon Plan was for the good of mankind.
</div>
<br>


	
<br>
<div class="par">
 However he has also been shown to be spiteful, degrading Tsunade while comparing her to her grandfather, after saying he would kill her first out of the five Kage because she was a Senju. Madara is, however, an honest individual and is willing to admit when he is wrong as after Tsunade tag-teamed him with A, he admitted she was not weak at all. Madara is also willing to admit when someone is stronger than he is as he openly admitted that Hashirama could stop him during his battle with the five Kage. Madara, however, isn't above reprimanding others for recklessness or stupidity as he criticised Tsunade for attacking him without thinking of what the other Kage would do for treatment if she was killed and criticised the five Kage as a group for worrying too much about the flowers in his technique and not watching their backs. He also has a habit of referring to fighting as 'dancing'.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara has a dark sense of humour, as shown when he created multiple wood clones and surrounded each of the five Kage with five clones — thereby reversing the original five vs. one situation — and asked if they preferred the clones to use Susanoo or not,[34] referred to incinerating the forest as "creating coal" after knocking the five Kage into it,and when asked by Naruto what had happened to the Kage, he stated that they were "not okay".[36] He has a very jaded and emotionless approach towards the tragedies of war, to the point of light-heartedly joking about them, as seen from his cheer at having "destroyed the alliance's mind", which further demonstrates his knack for reversing the situations he finds himself in.
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara also believes power is something tangible that can be passed down through generations and that the will of a dead person cannot be inherited, as it is not tangible.[38] While contesting Hashirama for the title of Hokage, Madara in his own way, was very loyal to Konohagakure, as he tried to force Iwagakure into serving Konoha, even after an alliance had been formed between the two villages.Despite his pride and confidence in his immense power, Madara is shown to be very cautious as he created a wood clone of himself at some point when the five Kage lost sight of him, in order to lessen the chances that they would catch him off guard.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
As an Uchiha, Madara possesses an innate hatred for the Senju clan,as what is known as the Curse of Hatred, which dates back to the early days of the ninja world. This curse led him to oppose the truce fearing that his clan would be oppressed by them, and when Hashirama was selected to be Hokage instead of Madara, he defected from Konoha and attempted to attack the village after failing to replace him. His animosity towards Hashirama was particularly strong, going as far as to forbid Onoki from mentioning that name in front of him ever again. 
Nevertheless, Madara possesses a high level of respect and admiration for Hashirama as well as the Senju name as seen during the Fourth Shinobi World War where he would praise and curse Hashirama or other members of the clan in the same breath.Conversely, he also lamented that he would have taught Hashirama how to resurrect himself if he had known how much weaker the modern day shinobi would be compared to them.Madara was very competitive with his younger brother, Izuna, but Tobi also implies that Madara and Izuna were close as brothers.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara is seemingly treacherous by nature as, after the alliance with Iwagakure was made, he immediately betrayed Mu and Onoki, expecting them to follow Konohagakure's lead from then on. The Uchiha also believed Madara stole Izuna's eyes by force in order to escape blindness. He is also a battle-loving individual, commenting that he had not enjoyed this view in a long time while surveying the battlefield during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Relating to this, Madara enjoys a challenging fight and said that anything less than the five Kage against him would be inadequate. Madara is also very bold when it comes to battle, shown in his ready assault of an entire platoon of shinobi upon being attacked, despite being severely outnumbered.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Despite his love of battle, Madara never loses his composure to excitement or fear in any of his battle situations. Also despite his love of battle, if Madara becomes bored with a fight, he will express disgust if his opponents try to force him to keep fighting, making him somewhat of a hypocrite.[45] Madara is also something of a show off, as shown in his use of extremely powerful techniques in rapid succession, all the while, expressing satisfaction to having done it. He also purposely let himself get hit by Onoki's attack in order to show Hashirama's face on his chest to lower the morale of the Kage. Madara also showed the five Kage the true power of his perfect Susanoo by destroying an entire mountain range before administering the finishing blow. Due to the times he lived in, Madara believes it is natural for shinobi to spend their entire lives in battle. He also thinks that the world can't change from what it was in the past and believes that as such, mankind would be better served sleeping peacefully in an Infinite Tsukuyomi.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara has been described as being hostile and aggressive by nature as well as being very ambitious, the latter of which was seen during his rise to the position of clan leader as well as his desire to make his clan superior out of what Tobi claimed was Madara's great love for them. Madara had a sense of honour as, prior to their betrayal of him, he wanted to protect the Uchiha clan from the possibility of oppression by the Senju after failing to replace Hashirama as Hokage. Madara also views the tailed beasts as nothing more than masses of energy and tools too lacking in intelligence and sapience to think for themselves and as such, need to be "guided" by the Uchiha to learn their purpose and believes that they are but slaves to those with blessed eyes. 
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
Despite his aggressiveness, Madara has displayed restraint, withholding his full power when he doesn't need it, as he stated to the Third Tsuchikage that the reason that he went so easy on him when they fought in the past was because he didn't think an adult should fight seriously against a child, as well as expressing his wish to further explore the powers of his enhanced body but refusing to do so against a seriously injured Onoki. He is also somewhat of a perfectionist, as though Tobi claimed that the Ten-Tails' revival does not have to be perfect to advance the Eye of the Moon Plan,[47] Madara noted this, along with his revival being different from the original plan, as acts of impatience and proceeded to correct the mistake.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="par">
As an old man, Madara seemed to be very bitter and disillusioned about reality, noticing that in this world someone always must be the "loser" so someone other can be the "winner", likely referring to his constant streak of failures against Hashirama Senju. This is what motivated him to wish to change the world via the Eye of the Moon Plan, and he would pass on this mindset to Obito. After his reincarnation, Madara noted that Obito had become much like him,in both actions and attitude — something which Madara seemed pleased about.
</div>

<br><br><br>

<span class="subheadings1">
SPECIAL SKILLS
</span>
<hr size="3" color="blue" width="100%">
<br><br>

<div class="par">
Madara is considered by many notable individuals to be one of the most gifted shinobi in history and the most powerful shinobi that the Uchiha clan has ever produced. The fact that he fought and survived every battle he ever fought with Hashirama Senju, who was recognised as the strongest ninja in the world in his time, also indicates that Madara was also one of the strongest ninja of his time. Madara was noted to have been born with an extremely powerful chakra, even by the Uchiha standards,which Kurama claimed to be far more sinister than that of its own.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Overall, Madara's fame and status was so great that his name alone was enough to incite terror, and Tobi was able to use that to his advantage to instigate a world war.Madara's very presence in the battlefield during the Fourth Shinobi World War was menacing enough to compel the five Kage to confront him together, feeling any less than their combined efforts would not be enough to stop Madara. 
He, in fact, proved to be so overwhelmingly powerful that he was able to overpower the five Kage multiple times by himself without even using the full extent of his powers and leave them in a state of awe and fear when he manifested his final Susanoo. Tsunade was so baffled by Madara's extraordinary prowess as a ninja that she questioned how it was possible that her grandfather had really defeated such an opponent in the past when they, the five Kage, couldn't do so in the present.This testament to Madara's incredible power was later shown further when he managed to defeat all five of the current Kage at once by himself.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Due to the manner of his revival and the experiments done by Kabuto, Madara retained access to abilities he obtained late in life (like his Wood Release and Rinnegan), while at the same time retaining the youthful body of his prime.After activating the Rinnegan and using it in conjunction with his Susanoo, Madara's abilities led Gaara to wonder if he had the power of a god as he sent a meteorite hurtling towards the Fourth Division.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Taijutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara is a very adept taijutsu fighter, possessing notable physical strength, great speed, and remarkable reflexes. He was capable of easily disarming a sword-wielding shinobi, before the latter could react.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
With a single roundhouse kick, he was able to repel a shinobi twice his size into an oncoming group of shinobi, knocking them all off their feet.Madara was also able to easily dodge Gaara's high-speed sand attacks, Mei's close range Lava Release attack, and even guard himself against A's punch while the latter was clad in his Lightning Release Armour as well as guarding himself against Tsunade's kick, who herself had suddenly appeared on the battlefield, without being protected by Susanoo.
</div>

<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Ninjutsu
Nature Transformation
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">
As the former leader of the Uchiha, Madara is a master of Fire Release nature transformation, displayed in his use of devastating fire techniques such as the Fire Release: Great Fire Annihilation technique which required the combination of numerous Water Release: Water Encampment Walls to extinguish,and the Fire Release: Great Fire Destruction technique which he used to incinerate a large portion of the forest he had created. He can also create dragon-shaped fireballs for a wide barrage at an enemy. The flames were enough to burn even Tsunade while she had the Strength of a Hundred Technique still active.
In the anime, Madara could also use Wind Release through his trademark gunbai to create powerful gusts of wind.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
After his confrontation with Hashirama Senju at the Valley of the End, Madara acquired a portion of his DNA, which after a long period of adaptation, granted him the Wood Release nature transformation. With this Madara has demonstrated the ability to instantly create numerous massive trees with which to attack his opponents directly,and a dense forest of flowering trees, whose pollen can render a foe unconscious. He is able to merge with and hide within trees.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
He is also capable of creating single or multiple wood clones using the pre-existing vegetation and wood in the immediate vicinity as a medium.Madara can even use Hashirama's Wood Dragon, which according to him was capable of binding Kurama during his final battle against the Senju leader.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
This was shown in battle against Naruto, where the dragon managed to completely bind Naruto, Killer B and Guy and absorb the full-Kurama cloak from Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode while growing trees across its length. Using Hashirama's cells, Madara can produce a series of roots from his body that can connect to and grant him control over a tailed beast, even one as powerful as the Ten-Tails. The level of control exerted is apparently linked to the number of roots that are connected to the beast, though he noted that his and Obito's control over the Ten-Tails was not perfect.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Madara's prowess with Wood Release is noteworthy, his skill was noted by both Kabuto and Gyuki to be on par with that of the First Hokage.As a user, Madara can use its component natures: earth and water.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Madara also displayed an extensive knowledge of Yin–Yang Release, its component Yin and Yang as well as techniques which involved this kind of nature manipulation such as Izanagi. Madara noted that the White Zetsu clones were created using the Yin–Yang Release and also used this ability to create Black Zetsu by infusing part of his will into White Zetsu and also infused his will into one of his chakra receivers. He would later teach these techniques to Obito as well.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Bukinujutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara has been shown wielding a wide range of weaponry throughout the series. His trademark weapon is the gunbai. The one he used is durable enough to block a miniature Tailed Beast Ball, as well as absorb the force of an enemy attack and then send it back.By flowing chakra through the gunbai, Madara can produce a large barrier that was strong enough to block the giant chakra receiver stakes thrown by Naruto in his Tailed Beast Mode.In an anime cutscene, he was also shown using it to produce strong gusts of wind.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
In addition to the gunbai, he had a large kama with him, using both weapons in conjunction with each other when his final confrontation against Hashirama took place,and later used one as a makeshift cane in his twilight years.Madara also carried various different swords throughout the years, and was shown as a skilled and versatile swordsman, most prominently seen during the Fourth Shinobi World War.His arsenal also included several giant shuriken and a chain with weights.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
After awakening the Rinnegan, Madara also gained access to the chakra receiver rods, one of which he used to contain his will, which would be used for his revival.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
kenjutsu
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Within his weapon skills, Madara has shown especial proficiency with kenjutsu, aptly demonstrated when he effortlessly disarmed a shinobi, commandeered his sword and used it to cut down several members of the Fourth Division with ease, while wielding the blade in a reverse grip. He displayed great manoeuvrability and dexterity while using kenjutsu. The speed of his attacks were so great that none of the shinobi he killed using this combat tactic had any time to react.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Dojutsu
Sharingan
</div>

<br>
<div class="par">
Madara managed to master the Sharingan at a young age — a feat which he received significant praise for.Using it, he gains access to the dojutsu's generic abilities such as seeing chakra, predicting movements, and placing a victim under paralysing genjutsu with just a single glance, leading those who had faced him to advise others to not look directly at his eyes whilst confronting him.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Madara is able to use these abilities in conjunction with his primed taijutsu and kenjutsu skills in battle to deadly effects, leaving his opponents with very little time to react or means of defence. The perceptive abilities of Madara's Sharingan were also considerable as he was the only one who could discern Hashirama's use of wood clones when the Uchiha and the Senju fought against each other.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
With his Sharingan, Madara is able to control the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox and is also one of the two known people along with Tobi, that are capable of summoning the beast. However, its sealing inside various jinchuriki, presently Naruto Uzumaki, has rendered him unable to summon the beast.He is also capable of using one of his clan's most powerful and forbidden dojutsu, Izanagi.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Mangekyo Sharingan
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">
Madara and his brother Izuna were the first Uchiha to awaken the Mangekyo Sharingan. However, after his eyesight progressively worsened to blindness through its use, Madara took and implanted Izuna's eyes into his own body, which then awakened a new "Eternal" Mangekyo Sharingan — a combination of his own and Izuna's Mangekyo. With it, he never had to fear the risk of losing his eyesight again.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Madara has since used his Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to control the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.Madara demonstrated the ability to use Susanoo — and is therefore also able to use Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu by extension — though they have yet to be seen. Unseen in others' variations, Madara's Susanoo demonstrates two entirely different sides that are conjoined along the spine, with each displaying a pair of arms, a face that is distinct from the other, and a complete lower half inclusive of feet.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
His Susanoo's defensive capabilities are high, even in its ribcage state, having withstood Naruto Uzumaki's Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan and A's Lightning Oppression Horizontal Chop with no damage.t wields undulating blades in the right hand of each side and it appears to be capable of contributing towards some of Madara's techniques, as it was seen forming hand seals together with him during battle. Madara is also able to use the Yasaka Magatama technique.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
Madara's Susanoo's final form is an enormous construct with its mouth obscured and a body similar to its full body form. The outer armour, which only remotely resembles the usual tengu with armour, and the trademark pillbox hat-like adornment on the forehead is split down the middle from the beak downwards where the normal Susanoo underneath is revealed. Along this armour, which seems much more fluid than the other known Susanoo's, are holes at the end. In its stabilised form, the Susanoo dons an outer armour and a samurai outfit. It also has four arms, two plated ones which hold a pair of katana in sheaths, the other pair of which wields them.[56] According to Madara, this Susanoo's power is comparable with that of a tailed beast[88] and he was able to repel and corner all five of the current Kage, while simultaneously demolishing a large portion of the mountain range behind them with a single sword swing.
</div>
<br>

<div class="subheadings2">
Rinnegan
</div>

<br>

<div class="par">
After integrating Hashirama's cells into his wounds, Madara noted that nothing happened. However when he was nearing the end of his life, he awakened the Rinnegan. With the Rinnegan, Madara can summon the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.
Madara possesses the ability to switch between both it, and his Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan at will.However, it should be noted that while using the powers granted by the Rinnegan he has not, except in the case of Susanoo, shown to be able to simultaneously access those granted by the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.Like other users, Madara is able to use the Six Paths Technique, displaying use of the Preta Path, with which he was able to absorb the chakra from one of Naruto's Rasenshuriken and even a complex kekkei tota like Onoki's Dust Release technique.
</div>
<br>
<div class="par">
When these abilities were combined with his Susanoo, he can pull two massive meteorites towards the battlefield from the atmosphere above.[94] Even if the first meteorite was slowed down and stopped, the second one would strike the first, ensuring their collision. Using this technique just a single time, Madara devastated most of the Fourth Division.
