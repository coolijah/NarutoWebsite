<div class="par">
    Kumogakure is the shinobi village of the Land of Lightning and is one the five great shinobi villages. The cloud ninjas specialize in lightning or electric-based jutsus. Approximately 12 years ago, the Hidden Cloud and the Hidden Leaf signed a peace treaty to end a long and costly war. However, the the leader of the Cloud delegation, Gashira, attempted to kidnap Hinata Hyuga in order to steal the secrets of the Byakugan. But Hinata’s father, Hiashi, killed the Cloud shinobi. The Cloud denied the abduction and threatened to break off the peace treaty. To avoid war, Konoha accepted to give the dead body of Gashira’s killer. Neji’s father, Hirashi, who was Hiashi’s twin brother, was used in place of his brother to trick the Hidden Cloud.</div>
